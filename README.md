# Disclaimer:
__Don't use this__ on production systems (or even DEV, Testing, Pre-Prod, UAT, etc.) it will break something and probably lock you out of your system.

# Intended use:
* For testing only!
* If you're curious about the affect a certain hardening topic will have, and you have some free time, then this may be useful.
* Apply hardening to CentOS/RHEL servers running on physical hardware.
* For VMs, you'd be better off creating a hardened image and deploying a new VM from that.

# Rationale:
Since hardening is a very time-consuming task, I've stripped down the lengthy document to only include what I consider the essential details to apply hardening to a CentOS/RHEL system.

I've omitted many of the items marked as (Not Scored) and only left the most pedestrian comments for my own benefit and amusement.
